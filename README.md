# myStuff
myStuff is an information storage and recall app.  I'd say its a note taking app but note taking apps are all terrible! 

This app I've spent a couple years designing in my head. Like many others I've experienced a lifetime of frustration trying to store info in usable and findable
ways in various note keeping apps. The main problem with note keeping apps is the more stuff you put in them, the worse the experience becomes.
The reason for that is our organizing stratetgies for tagging or naming or foldering, is never perfect, and it is just flat out too hard to
recover from organizing problems you've created in the past.  You've mislabeled a lot of things, or one category should be split into two, or some things 
should exist in more than one place. I've fixed all these problems with THE SIMPLEST user interface possible.  I think this note keeping design will 
become the new standard for note keeping apps. 

to get this running you may have to update the user name and password for the mysql connection index.js line 22 and 23.
